## Project Description and Goals

The [traditional music notation system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musical_notation#Modern_staff_notation) that we know today dates back to the 16th century. It has evolved over time and has been widely used by musicians across genres all over the world. But due to its gradual evolution, traditional notation is not a good visual representation of music. For example, accidentals (sharps and flats) in traditional notation change the pitch of a note without changing its position on the staff. As a result, although G to G# is a half step and B to C is a half step, G and G# appear on the same line while B and C appear in different places. This ambiguity makes it hard to visualize relative differences in pitch. Through our research project, we intend to identify other ways in which music can be better visualized and to develop a system of visualization that implements these ideas so that musical patterns which are unclear in traditional notation can be easily recognized in our visualization.

The first objective of our research project is to analyze existing alternative music notations. Through this study, we will gain insight into the reasons behind each notation's creation and what makes it distinct from the traditional system of music notation. This will allow us to make an informed decision about the implementation of our visualization system. With the knowledge that we have gathered, we will then develop a system of music visualization that draws from the strengths of the different music notation systems.

Our second objective is to explore different possibilities for our music visualization system. We will first look into existing music visualization techniques to gain insight into different ways of visualizing music. One such example is Nicholas Rougeux's project, [*Off the Staff*](https://www.c82.net/offthestaff/). By analyzing and drawing inspiration from the different music visualization techniques, we can determine which aspects of visualization to implement in our system.

The next objective of our project is to conduct research on existing computer programs in the area of music to analyze the pros and cons of different programming languages. In this way, we hope to determine which programming language is best fitted for our needs. We will also look into the different platforms on which we can implement our program—web, desktop or mobile—based on feasibility, functionality and user accessibility.

Our fourth, ultimate objective is to create a computer application that demonstrates our system of music visualization with a specific piece of music. We will consider different ways to make the resulting program interactive and easily accessible, including allowing playback so that users can correlate the music to the visual representation. Through our visualization system, we hope to provide a new, insightful, and interesting way to look at music. Our visualization system will allow a casual viewer to easily identify patterns in the music, while more experienced musicians will be able to correlate these patterns to various musical elements. These elements might include chord progressions, modulation, dynamics, tempi, articulations, and underlying structure, many of which are difficult to recognize in traditional notation. In addition, we hope that this visualization system will make music less intimidating for those unfamiliar with music by helping to break down a work into its component parts. This would allow beginners to examine individual elements without being overwhelmed by the complexity of the work as a whole, thus making music more approachable.
 


## Methodology

The first goal of our project is to analyze existing alternative music notations. First, we will read the results of the Music Notation Modernization Association (MNMA) Research Project. The research project evaluated over 500 music notation systems, which are included in Directory of Music Notation Proposals by Thomas Reeds. The report details the screening process of the notation systems, which will give us additional insight into what constitutes an ideal notation system. In addition, the report identifies and ranks the top 37 notation systems, from which we can draw inspiration. We will also read Alternatives to Traditional Notation by Mark Gaare, which points out some of the shortcomings of traditional music notation and identifies some existing alternative notations that have gained popularity.

Our second goal is to explore possibilities for our music visualization system. We will research Nicholas Rougeux's project, *Off the Staff*, a good example of the kind of insightful visualization we are trying to create. We will also read Yunli Lee's Interactive Music Visualization for Music Player Using Processing to gain a wider perspective of the types of visualization we can adopt for our system. By analyzing and drawing inspiration from the different music visualization techniques, we can determine which aspects of visualization to implement in our system. Additionally, we will consult with professors in the Music Department at LMU to obtain feedback on our choice of visual representation.

The third goal of our project is to determine a suitable way to implement our computer application. First, we will look at existing software for notating and visualizing music to draw ideas from. Through this research, we can analyze and determine which programming language would be best suited for our needs. We will also determine whether to implement our program as a web application, a mobile application, or a desktop application by considering the feasibility and functionality of each. During this process, we will work closely with Dr. Dionisio to obtain feedback and suggestions on our ideas.

The final product of our research will be a computer application that showcases our new music visualization system. The application will allow for music playback and an interactive comparison with the traditional notation system. Our current ideas for the application include an option to pick one of five well-known pieces to be visualized. The visualization system will allow patterns that exist in music to be more easily recognized, even by inexperienced musicians. In addition, we hope that it will make music more approachable by breaking music down into its component parts. 



## Timeline


#### Week 1: May 20–24

To address our first goal, we will read the results of the Music Notation Modernization Association (MNMA) Research Project and itemize the flaws and strengths of the different alternative music notations. We will also read Alternatives to Traditional Notation by Mark Gaare and start brainstorming and drafting ideas for our second goal. We will begin to interview the professors in the Music Department at LMU to receive feedback and suggestions on our project.


#### Week 2: May 27–31

We will continue to develop ideas for our music visualization system, referencing Nicholas Rougeux's *Off the Staff* project and consulting with professors of music at LMU. We will also look at different software that works with music notation and visualization to draw ideas and inspiration from for our third goal. We will consult with Dr. Dionisio to discuss and determine a suitable programming language and platform for our program.


#### Week 3: June 3–7

We will begin writing our program after some study and hands-on practice with the programming language that we chose to use. Throughout the week, we will check in with Dr. Dionisio to report on our progress and receive preliminary feedback or suggestions on our program.


#### Week 4: June 10–14

We will continue to write our program. By the end of this week, we expect to have half of the code written. We will also finalize our options for the pieces that will be available to the user to demonstrate our visualization system. We will design our program to work with musicXML, a standard music file format, so that we can use existing transcriptions of said pieces and manipulate them for our visualization system.


#### Week 5: June 17–21

We will continue to write our program. We will also consult with Dr. Dionisio regarding our progress and receive feedback on the functionality of our program for areas of improvement.


#### Week 6: June 24–28

In the final week, we will finish writing our program. We will perform some functionality tests on our program to ensure usability. We will write and finalize our final abstract and reflection. We will also prepare a presentation and demo of our program.
